DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC:
Please be concise! (< 200 words)
What question you are trying to answer with your statistic? 
What data did you need to organize? 
What was interesting or challenging about the implementation of this statistic? 

My statistic was to find for each team given, what days did each team win the most on. (output is sorted according to team_stats sorting)
I needed to add the days_played (vector<float>) attribute to my team class and modify my team processing to update the attribute accordingly
At first I implemented a similar statistics but changed it to my current one. Through my modifications and debugging, I realized how picky c++ was with type declarations and interactions between items with different types.

NAME OF FILE WITH SAMPLE OUTPUT FROM 3RD STATISTIC:

MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  

all methods that deal with players start with "p_"
all methods that deal with teams start with "t_"
custom stat processing relies on team processing
