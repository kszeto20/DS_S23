TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your implementation?

I used Valgrind. I did not test corner cases.



MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
(optional, please be concise!)
I didn't finish print_BFS, I don't understand what I'm supposed to do with it. The directions were unclear.
